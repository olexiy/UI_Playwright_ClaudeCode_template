   - Helps with selector discovery
   - Assists with test debugging
   - Generates test code snippets

### Optional MCP Servers

2. **GitHub MCP** (If using GitHub)
   - Manage issues and PRs
   - Automated test failure reporting
   - CI/CD integration

3. **SQLite MCP** (For test data management)
   - Manage test databases

   - Analyze test history

---

## 📋 Installation Guide

### Step 1: Install Playwright MCP

```bash
# Using Claude Code CLI
claude mcp add microsoft/playwright-mcp

# Or manually add to ~/.claude.json
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation

```bash
# Check installed MCP servers
claude mcp list
```

### Step 3: Test MCP Server

In Claude Code:
```
"Use Playwright to navigate to https://your-app-url.com and take a screenshot"
```

## 💡 Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Exploring Website Structure

**Without MCP:**
- Manually browse the website
- Use browser DevTools
- Guess selectors
- Trial and error

**With Playwright MCP:**
```
"Navigate to the application homepage and provide:
1. Page structure
2. Main navigation elements
3. Recommended selectors for key elements
4. Any accessibility issues"
```

### Scenario 2: Creating New Tests

**Without MCP:**
- Write test from scratch
- Manually identify selectors
- Test and debug repeatedly

**With Playwright MCP:**
```
"Create a smoke test that:
1. Navigates to the application
2. Performs a key user action (e.g., search)
3. Verifies expected results are displayed
4. Uses Page Object Model pattern"
```

### Scenario 3: Debugging Test Failures

**Without MCP:**
- Read error logs
- Add debug statements
- Run tests repeatedly
- Check screenshots

**With Playwright MCP:**
```
"The checkout button test is failing. Navigate to the checkout page and:
1. Check if the button exists
2. Verify it's visible
3. Check if it's clickable
4. Identify any blocking elements
5. Suggest fixes"
```

### Scenario 4: Selector Validation

**Without MCP:**
- Run test to check selector
- Modify if it fails
- Run again

**With Playwright MCP:**
```
"Check if this selector works on the target page:
'[data-testid='submit-button']'

If not, suggest better alternatives."
```

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Security
- MCP servers run with your permissions
- Be cautious with production environments
- Don't expose sensitive credentials
- Review generated code before execution

### Performance
- MCP servers add some overhead
- Use for development, not production test runs
- Consider disabling unused servers

### Limitations
- MCP is not a replacement for proper tests
- Generated code needs review
- Use as an assistant, not automation

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Use MCP for Exploration
```
✅ "Explore the search functionality and document it"
✅ "Find all navigation sections and their URLs"
✅ "Analyze the main user workflow steps"
```

### 2. Use MCP for Code Generation
```
✅ "Generate a POM for the product detail page"
✅ "Create test fixtures for user data"
✅ "Generate a test for newsletter subscription"
```

### 3. Use MCP for Debugging
```
✅ "Debug why this test is failing: [test code]"
✅ "Check if this selector is stable across pages"
✅ "Analyze this flaky test and suggest fixes"
```

### 4. Review Generated Code
```
✅ Always review MCP-generated code
✅ Ensure it follows project standards
✅ Add proper error handling
✅ Include appropriate comments
```

## 🔄 Integration with Claude Code Commands

MCP servers complement Claude Code slash commands:

| Slash Command | MCP Enhancement |
|---------------|-----------------|
| `/create-pom` | Use Playwright MCP to discover elements first |
| `/add-smoke-test` | Use MCP to validate selectors |
| `/debug-test` | Use MCP for real-time debugging |
| `/analyze-coverage` | Use MCP to explore uncovered areas |

### Example Workflow

1. **Exploration Phase**
   ```
   Use Playwright MCP: "Explore product search functionality"
   ```

2. **Planning Phase**
   ```
   Use Command: /analyze-coverage
   ```

3. **Implementation Phase**
   ```
   Use Command: /create-pom ProductSearchPage
   Use Command: /add-regression-test search functionality
   ```

4. **Validation Phase**
   ```
   Use Playwright MCP: "Validate selectors in ProductSearchPage.ts"
   ```

5. **Debugging Phase**
   ```
   Use Command: /debug-test tests/regression/search/search-filters.spec.ts
   ```
